subtitle: Why I am taking Electronic Textiles
---

Have you ever thought about the behind-the-scenes of creating wearable technology? For me, I'd never asked myself what tools or programming went into it until I came across CSCI-103 Electronic Textiles. As someone with a curious mindset, I was intrigued by this course's objective to learn to sew, create prototypes, and program an Arduino, skills I want to not only develop but sharpen. I also want to strengthen my debugging skills, since I feel it directly supports problem-solving overall. My drive to learn the foundations of creating wearable technology, while also challenging myself to take on a course and topic I am very unfamiliar with, is why I am taking Electronic Textiles this semester.
