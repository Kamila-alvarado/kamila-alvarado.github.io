Description, photo, and a tip.

### About this assignment
This program aims to play the song Happy Birthday when the button is pressed.

### A tip I would give to my past self is...
to make sure to declare only one variable for the button, because I ran into a conflict where my song wouldn’t play because the code I copied already had a button variable, so having just one solves the issue
