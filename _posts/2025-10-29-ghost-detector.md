Description, photo, and a tip.

### About this assignment
This program will turn on red lights on the arduino when the room temperature is cold and when the brightness is dark.

### Photo of Arduino kit output

### A tip I would give to my past self is...
to make sure that in the void set up I have the correct functions of the variables listed- not mixing my inputs for outputs and vice versa.
