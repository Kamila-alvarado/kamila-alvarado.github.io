### About this assignment
Using the foundation of programming skills we've deveoped, this part of the project aims to program 3 seperate LEDSs, each with a distinct blinking pattern.

### A photo of each of ALL 3 working sets of LEDs

2) Bigdipper
Had trouble testing on Lilypad device.

3) Synchronus
Had trouble testing on Lilypad device.

### One tip for others attempting this project for the first time.
One thing I would recommend is asking your professor or TA for help whenever you feel stuck, even if itâ€™s just for clarification. For example, I felt stuck on the synchronous program, but with their help, I discovered some shortcuts or more efficient tools to navigate it such as using boolean logic.
