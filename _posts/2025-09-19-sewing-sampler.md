Hi, my name is Kamila Alvarado and I am a first-year at Williams College. I am interested in the field of psychology, but I am also enthusiastic to explore the variety of fields Williams has to offer, including Computer Science. That is why I am taking CSCI 103 - Electronic Textiles.

### Programming Experience

My first introduction to the world of Computer Science was during my sophomore year of high school. I decided to push myself to take a class I had been shying away from for so long: Game Programming. Although the class gave me a basic foundation in using JavaScript and collaborating with classmates to debug code, I found it very challenging, and the information and patterns didnâ€™t always stick. Since I last took the course in my sophomore year and am now a first-year in college, I decided to give programming another chance and see how my passion for it evolves.
