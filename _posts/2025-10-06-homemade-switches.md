The aim was to create a simple circuit with one LED and two distinct homemade switches that only light the LED when both are pressed.

### Alligator prototyping 
I forgot to take a picture after completing the prototyping stage with the alligator clips, but this is a recreated image of what the connections would’ve looked like beforehand.

### Paper Prototype
I made adjustments, specifically to the final fabric I used for my design.

### Tip
I would tell myself to work with more space. Although smaller designs might seem more manageable and help save fabric, they’re actually more difficult since loose fabric can cause circuits to form incorrectly if not sewn properly.
