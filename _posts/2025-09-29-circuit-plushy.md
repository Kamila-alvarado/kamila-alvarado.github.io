### Tip for 'past self'

One thing I would tell my ‘past self’ when approaching sewing is to take it one step and one stitch at a time. This asgnment has taught me the patience and time needed to complete a specific stitch. For example, with the backstitch, I aimed to keep my segments even so the “Williams” lettering looked cohesive. But at times, I rushed, pushing the needle through one side without fully pulling it out, causing the yarn to tangle and slowing me down. That’s when I realized it’s better to go steady than to try finishing too quickly.
