For this project, I creatied a plushy that lights up using both a slide switch and a button. The electronic parts are connected with conductive thread, and the plushy itself is sewn together with regular, non-conductive thread.

### Alligator prototyping stage of the Plushy
I forgot to take a picture after completing the prototyping stage with the alligator clips, but this is a recreated image of what the connections would’ve looked like beforehand.

### Tip for others attempting this project for the first time

One thing I would recommend is to make sure there are no conductive threads touching each other in areas they’re not supposed to be, since this can cause a short circuit and stop the circuit from working. Always check this before sewing on the two sides of the plushy.
