Description, photo, and a tip.

### About this assignment
This program aims to pick a random analog pin. If it’s alreafy on, it turns it off. If it’s off, it gives it a random brightness to turn it on.

### A tip I would give to my past self is...
to always, first, consider using a boolean statement- in the case of this assignment it would be to track the on and off states corresponding to the PWM pins.
