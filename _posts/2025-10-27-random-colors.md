### Tip I would like to give to my past self while completing this deliverable
A tip I would give to my past self is to declare separate integers inside the loop() to generate and display the random color. Without this, I got glitching lights that alternated the RGB pins 12, 13, and 14, so the colors weren’t actually randomized—they just repeated every time the button was pressed.
