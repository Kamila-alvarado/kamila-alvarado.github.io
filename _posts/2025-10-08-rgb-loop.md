Description, output reuslt, and a tip to my past self.

### About this assignment
This assignemnt aims to use nested ifs to show a restaurant’s regular or secret menu, based on numberChoice and mealOption.

### Screenshot of an example output when numberChoice = 7 &  mealOption = 3

### Tip for my 'past self'
One thing I would tell my past self is to leave comments marking where the secret and regular menus are, so I don’t confuse them when inserting values, like I did before.
