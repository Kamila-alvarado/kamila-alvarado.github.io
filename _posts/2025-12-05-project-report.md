Project Report of my Final Project 

### Description:
My final project is a holiday sweater for my dog that plays the holiday tune Feliz Navidad when the button is pressed. Additionally, when the light sensor detects darkness, the LED “Christmas lights” will fade in and out in red, followed by the same effect in green.
 
### Motivation:
My dog was the main inspiration for this project, along with the holiday season. This sweater will keep him warm on cold nights and provide a gentle light, making it easier to see him while we walk around the neighborhood. It also adds a festive touch and lets him look stylish. The music is one of my favorite holiday tunes to enjoy with my family.

### Revised paper prototype of your project

(Focus on the components and how you'll connect them in a circuit
Must be legible! Digital images work well (i.e., grab component images from the Product Website
Links to an external site., then connect them in PowerPoint or other image editing software). Will need to be a .JPG, .PNG, .GIF, etc in order to appear on your course website. Should look professional/polished.)

### Three tips to your past self

1) When working with code you’re not familiar with, such as music code, ask for help to better understand how it works and to simplify any complex parts.

2) Make sure to adjust the light sensor threshold depending on your environment, as it may need to change whenever you move locations.

3) If you know your code works and it runs properly when tested with alligator clips, but your components still aren’t responding, the problem is likely the conductive thread, which can weaken or loosen over time, so always retrace areas to ensure good connections.
