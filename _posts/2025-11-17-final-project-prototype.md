### About about my Paper Prototype

This prototype displays the connections between all my digital and analog inputs and outputs, along with other components such as the LilyPad Arduino and the battery. The logic behind what my prototype aims to do is the following: when the button is pressed, the buzzer plays a holiday song. In addition, when the room becomes dark enough (sensor value below the threshold), the three LEDs light up.
