### About about my Paper Prototype

This prototype displays the connections between all my digital/analog inputs and outputs, with other components as well, including the Lilypad arduino and battery. The logic behind  what my prototype aims to do is the following: If the switch is pressed then the buzzer plays song. In addition, if the light sensor value < threshold, then LEDs turn on.
