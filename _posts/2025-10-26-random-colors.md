Description, output reuslt, and a tip to my past self.

### About this assignment
The goal of this program is to use a loop in C to simulate LEDs turning on by printing the colors RED, GREEN, and BLUE at specific intervals.

### Screenshot of output

### Tip for my 'past self'
One thing I would tell my past self is to click on each bracket to see where the other end is highlighted, making sure every bracket matches correctly to avoid errors or endless loops that could cause the code to lag, like it did trying to figure out this code.


A post on your Project website with:

A single photo of at least one set of your LEDs on.

Include a description of the project (in your words)

One tip/trick/hint for others attempting this project for the first time.

Do not post your code!
