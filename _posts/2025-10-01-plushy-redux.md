Description, output reuslt, and a tip to my past self while completing this program.

### About this assignment
This assignment aims to use if statements to recreate the behavior of the Circuit Plushy with both the button and switch, further helping us develop our skills as Lilypad Arduino programmers.

### Screenshot of an example output when button and switch are ON

### Tip for my 'past self'
One thing I would tell my past self is to leave comments marking where the secret and regular menus are, so I donâ€™t confuse them when inserting values, like I did before.
