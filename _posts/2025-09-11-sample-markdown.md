Hi, my name is Kamila Alvarado and I am a first-year at Williams College. I am interested in the field of psychology, but I am also enthusiastic to explore the variety of fields Williams has to offer, including Computer Science. That is why I am taking CSCI 103 - Electronic Textiles.

### My Programming Experience

My first introduction to the world of Computer Science was during my sophomore year of high school. I decided to push myself to take a class I had been shying away from for so long: Game Programming. Although the class gave me a basic foundation in using JavaScript and collaborating with classmates to debug code, I found it very challenging, and the information and patterns didn’t always stick. Since I last took the course in my sophomore year and am now a first-year in college, I decided to give programming another chance and see how my passion for it evolves.

### My Sewing Experience

My experience with sewing is very limited. It began in fifth grade, when I joined my school’s art club. Because I had limited resources at home, I wasn’t able to continue exploring my interest in sewing and crocheting. However, I am now looking forward to rekindling that passion.

### What I hope to learn in this class

I hope to gain more confidence in sewing, programming an Arduino, and creating prototypes. Overall, I look forward to developing the skills necessary to complete my final project, an eTextiles product.

### Fun Fact about Me

I have a pug/french bulldog named Jack. He turned 6 this summer!

<!--I strongly encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown](https://markdowntutorial.com/) - it'll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/tables/etc.<br/>I also encourage you to look at the [code that created this post](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll/master/_posts/2020-02-28-sample-markdown.md) to learn some more advanced tips about using markdown in Beautiful Jekyll.

**Here is some bold text**

## Here is a secondary heading

[This is a link to a different site](https://deanattali.com/) and [this is a link to a section inside this page](#local-urls).

Here's a table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |

You can use [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) to write LaTeX expressions. For example:
When \\(a \ne 0\\), there are two solutions to \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) and they are $$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$



It can also be centered!

![Crepe](https://beautifuljekyll.com/assets/img/crepe.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.

## Local URLs in project sites {#local-urls}

When hosting a *project site* on GitHub Pages (for example, `https://USERNAME.github.io/MyProject`), URLs that begin with `/` and refer to local files may not work correctly due to how the root URL (`/`) is interpreted by GitHub Pages. You can read more about it [in the FAQ](https://beautifuljekyll.com/faq/#links-in-project-page). To demonstrate the issue, the following local image will be broken **if your site is a project site:**

![Crepe](/assets/img/crepe.jpg)

If the above image is broken, then you'll need to follow the instructions [in the FAQ](https://beautifuljekyll.com/faq/#links-in-project-page). Here is proof that it can be fixed:

![Crepe]({{ '/assets/img/crepe.jpg' | relative_url }})
