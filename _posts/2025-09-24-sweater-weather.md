Description, output reuslts, and a tip to my past self while completing this program.

### About this assignment
This assignment called Sweater Weather aims to provide us practice with if / else if / else statements and the && and || operators to support us with coding our prospective eTextile device.

### Tip for my 'past self'
One thing I would tell my 'past self' is to test one section at a time. For example, if I am inserting an else if after just finishing another else if, I would remind myself to first check the one I just finished to make sure there are no bugs. Tackling code in small parts makes debugging easier.
